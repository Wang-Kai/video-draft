Hello everyone, my name is Steve, it's my first Youtube video.

# Intruduce myself

I am a programmer and live in Shanghai, i have been working in Bilibili company for 4 years now. Do you hear about Bilibili? It can be said that it's a Chinese Youtube. The Youtube is a platform with global users, so i think it's more interting and i can make friends with different cultural backgrounds.

# Why i want to make the video?

Firstly, i make the video for practicing my spoken English. Actutally, as a 33 years ago man, i has never been abroad before. I every want to go abroad and see the world. So i want to improve spoken English and plan to visit the UK in 2025. Are you live in UK? Can you give me some suggestion?

Secondly, i want to talk with the people from all over the world. I want to exchange views with people outside of China. How much do you know about China? What's your favorite chinese food? I live in Shanghai, i can introduce many thing about it.

OK, is there any grammar error in my oral expression today? If you are a native English speaker, that would be great, welcome to identify my mistake.
