Hello everyone, my name is Steve, it's my first Youtube video.

**Intruduce myself**

I am a programmer and live in Shanghai, i've been working at Bilibili company for 4 years now. Do you hear of Bilibili? It can be said that it's a Chinese Youtube. Youtube is a platform with global users, so i think it's more interesting and i can connect with people from different cultural backgrounds.

**Why i want to make the video?**

Firstly, i'm making this video to practice my spoken English. Actutally, as a 33-year-old  man, i've never been abroad. I always wanted to go abroad and see the world. So i want to improve spoken English and plan to visit the UK in 2025. Are any of you from the UK? Do you have any suggestions?

Secondly, i want to talk with the people from all over the world. I want to exchange views with people outside of China. How much do you know about China? What's your favorite chinese food? I live in Shanghai, i can introduce you to many things.

OK, is there any grammar error in my oral expression today? If you are a native English speaker, that would be great, welcome to identify my mistake.
